# UTwente-Big-Geodata-Analytics-Methods-and-Distributed-Computing
### Overview of the course
Thanks to the digital, mobile, and sensor revolutions, massive amounts of data are becoming available at unprecedented spatial, temporal, and thematic scales. This leads to the practical problem of transforming big geodata sets into actionable information that supports decision-making at various scales, and that can be further processed to generate new knowledge.

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of big geodata processing. Then, you will be introduced (via lectures, demos, and exercises) to various big data solutions (such as distributed and cloud computing). After that, you will work on a real-life problem and use big data solutions. You will work in groups and create the necessary workflows to process the data. This will require programming skills and critical thinking to select the “best” algorithm and computational solution. In this course, there will also be a strong emphasis on Open Science principles, with a focus on scientific reproducibility. Tutorials on archiving data and code will be provided too. You will use the computational platform offered by the Center of Expertise in Big Geodata Science (CRIB). In this way, you can focus on content and do not need to worry about software.
